While blockchains publicly display wallet addresses by default, these long strings are not friendly for everyday use. Onchain naming systems like Basenames solve this by letting users register human-readable names (for example, "alice.base"). Beyond simple naming, onchain identity can be extended through verifications and attestations that prove additional facts (e.g., that a user is a verified account holder or resides in a specific country). Here, you'll learn how Basenames and onchain verifications work together to make your app more user-friendly and trustworthy.

## Why Identity Matters

<Info>
**Address Readability**: By default, wallet addresses are long, unreadable hex strings. Onchain names (like "alice.base") make it easier to identify recipients or users.
</Info>

<Tip>
**Trust Without Privacy Risk**: Attestations/Verifications allow your app to trust certain user attributesâ€”without exposing personal data offchain.
</Tip>

## Basenames

<Check>
**Human-Readable Names** for addresses on Base (akin to DNS for IPs)
</Check>

<Check>
**Unified Identity**: Users can register names, add a profile picture, and display them across all apps they connect to
</Check>

<Check>
**Reduced Friction**: Helps unify an onchain identity and reduce user friction
</Check>

## Onchain Verifications

<Info>
**The Challenge**: The chain can't natively see offchain data (e.g., your nationality or membership status).
</Info>

<Tip>
**The Solution**: Verifications let you post attestations **onchain** so other contracts can read them without privacy risks. For example, prove you're a Coinbase user, or a resident of a certain country, and automatically unlock special privileges in dapps.
