title: "Interacting with the Chain (Node Access)"
description: "Learn how blockchain node access works via RPC endpoints, comparing self-hosted vs hosted options, and how to integrate Base Node for stable onchain interactions."
---

Every time you read or write data on Base, you're making calls to a blockchain node via RPC (Remote Procedure Call) endpoints. You can host your own node or rely on a service like Base Node (via CDP). This sub-section explains why node access is crucial, compares self-hosted vs. hosted node options, and shows you how to integrate an RPC endpoint in your application for stable, scalable onchain interactions.

## Why You Need a Node

<Info>
Under the hood, apps read/write onchain data by making RPC calls to a blockchain node. You can self-host or use a managed service.
</Info>

Every blockchain interaction requires communication with a node that maintains the complete blockchain ledger. Whether you're checking wallet balances, sending transactions, or reading smart contract state, your application communicates through standardized JSON-RPC methods like `eth_getBalance`, `eth_sendTransaction`, and `eth_call`.

## RPC Endpoints Overview

Base provides public RPC endpoints for development and testing:

| Network | RPC Endpoint | Chain ID | Use Case |
| :------ | :----------- | :------- | :------- |
| Base Mainnet | `https://mainnet.base.org` | 8453 | Development only |
| Base Sepolia | `https://sepolia.base.org` | 84532 | Testing only |

<Warning>
These public endpoints are **rate-limited** and **not suitable for production systems**. For production applications, use a dedicated node provider or run your own node.
</Warning>

## Hosted Node Providers

For production applications, choose from Base's ecosystem of trusted node providers:

### Coinbase Developer Platform (CDP)
**Base Node** (via CDP) provides high-throughput access with a free tier available, plus enterprise-grade options. Built on the same infrastructure powering Coinbase's retail exchange for maximum reliability.

### Popular Provider Options
- **Alchemy**: Enhanced features, SDKs, free tier with robust JSON-RPC APIs
- **QuickNode**: Discover Plan with optional "Trace Mode" and "Archive Mode" add-ons
- **Chainstack**: Elastic RPC nodes with geographically diverse, protected API endpoints
- **Ankr**: Globally distributed decentralized network with free and paid tiers
- **OnFinality**: High-performance archive access with generous free tier and high rate limits

<Tip>
Most providers offer both mainnet and testnet (Sepolia) access. Compare pricing, rate limits, and features like archive data access when selecting a provider.
</Tip>

## Self-Hosted Base Node

### When to Run Your Own Node
Consider self-hosting when you need:
- Complete control over node configuration
- No external dependencies or rate limits
- Archive data access for historical queries
- Custom monitoring and analytics

### Hardware Requirements
Running a Base node requires significant resources:

- **CPU**: 8-Core processor with good single-core performance
- **RAM**: Minimum 16 GB (32 GB recommended)
- **Storage**: NVMe SSD with adequate capacity for chain data plus snapshots
  - Calculate: `(2 Ã— current_chain_size) + snapshot_size + 20% buffer`
- **Network**: Stable internet connection with good bandwidth

<Warning>
Running a node is **time-consuming**, **resource-expensive**, and **potentially costly**. Syncing can take days and consume significant bandwidth.
</Warning>

### Performance Considerations
- **Reth vs Geth**: Reth provides significantly better performance in Base's high-throughput environment
- **Archive Nodes**: Geth archive nodes are no longer supported; use Reth for archive functionality
- **Snapshots**: Weekly snapshots available to accelerate initial sync process
- **Storage**: Local NVMe SSDs strongly recommended over networked storage
