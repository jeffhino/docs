Building onchain with Base brings a new dimension to your appsâ€”trust-minimized logic, global accessibility, and open integrations with existing ecosystems (DeFi, social, AI, etc.). Now that you have the big picture, here are some suggested next steps:

* [Spin up your first Base Node endpoint](https://portal.cdp.coinbase.com/products/node)  
* [Use OnchainKit to build a basic wallet connection flow](https://onchainkit.xyz/)  
* [Integrate Paymaster for gasless transactions](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/paymaster/docs/welcome)  
* [Explore AI Onchain with AgentKit](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/agentkit/docs/welcome)  
* [Set up your Basename for a friendlier identity](https://www.base.org/names)

Happy Building!
