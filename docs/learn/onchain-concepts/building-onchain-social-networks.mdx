Traditional social media apps must build their user bases from scratch and can risk losing access to platform APIs. In contrast, onchain social networks (e.g., Farcaster) allow your app to tap into existing social graphs and user relationships immediately. This part covers how open social protocols foster collaboration, prevent centralized gatekeeping, and eliminate the "empty network" problem for new social apps.
