Before users can transact on Base, they need crypto in their wallets. Historically, this required lengthy steps via exchanges and bank transfers. Now, onramps like MagicSpend and CDP Onramp (and the drop-in FundButton components from OnchainKit) make this process faster and smoother. In this sub-section, discover how to integrate user-friendly fiat-to-crypto solutions directly into your app, reducing churn and lowering barriers to entry.
