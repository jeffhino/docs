# Basename Transfer Guide

## Transferring Your Basename to Your New Wallet

If you have an existing Basename you'd like to use, you'll need to transfer it to your new wallet address. We do not allow import or linking of pre-existing Basenames without transfer at this time.

### Before You Start

<Info>
  **Your new wallet address is ready**: We've automatically copied your new wallet address to your
  clipboard. You'll paste this when prompted.
</Info>

<Warning>
  **Make sure to use the Basenames UI to send Basenames properly, sends on platforms like OpenSea
  will only transfer the NFT.**
</Warning>

### Step-by-Step Transfer Process

1. **Navigate to Basenames**

   - Go to [base.org/names](https://base.org/names)
   - Sign in with your current wallet (the one that owns the Basename)

2. **Access Your Basenames**

   - Click **"My Basenames"** in the top right corner
   - Find the Basename you want to transfer

3. **Start the Transfer**

   - Click the **three dots** next to your Basename
   - Select **"Transfer name"**

4. **Enter Your New Address**

   - When prompted for the destination address, **paste your new wallet address** (Ctrl/Cmd + V)
   - The address is already on your clipboard

5. **Complete the Transfer**
   - Sign all **four transactions** in sequence:
     - Transfer token ownership
     - Transfer management rights
     - Change address resolution
     - Send the NFT
   - Each transaction updates a different aspect of your Basename ownership

### After the Transfer

Once the transfer is complete, you'll need to activate your Basename on your new wallet:

1. Switch to your new wallet
2. Go to [base.org/manage-names](https://base.org/manage-names)
3. Sign in with your new wallet
4. Find your transferred Basename and click the three dots
5. Select **"Set as primary"** and sign the transaction

<Info>
  **For the new owner to use the basename they will need to confirm by setting it as their primary
  name.**
</Info>

### What This Transfer Includes

When you complete all four transactions, you're transferring:

**Transfer token ownership** - transfers ownership of the Basename token and associated permissions.  
**Transfer management** - transfers ability to manage and update profile records.  
**Change address resolution** - Basename will resolve to a new address.

Transferring all 3 to the same address will fully transfer ownership of the Basename to that address.

### Need Help?

If you encounter any issues during the transfer process, make sure:

- You're using the correct wallet (your old one) to initiate the transfer
- You've pasted the correct new wallet address
- You're completing all four transactions in the sequence

Your Basename will be fully functional on your new wallet once the transfer and primary name setup are complete.
