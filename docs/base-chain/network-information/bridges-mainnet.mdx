description: Documentation for bridging assets to Base. This page covers how to bridge ETH and ERC-20s between Ethereum (L1) and Base along with essential information.

While the bridge on bridge.base.org has been deprecated, there are many bridges
that support moving assets between Base and other chains.

For questions, see our [FAQ](#faq).

## Garden

Garden is a fast non-custodial Bitcoin bridge that enables you to bridge BTC and other supported assets from Ethereum, Solana, and more, directly to Base.

#### Supported Networks

- [Base Mainnet](https://app.garden.finance/?output-chain=base&output-asset=cbBTC)
- [Base Sepolia (Testnet)](https://testnet.garden.finance/?output-chain=base_sepolia&output-asset=USDT)

## Superbridge

Superbridge enables you to bridge ETH and other supported assets from Ethereum mainnet (L1) directly to Base.

#### Supported Networks

- [Base Mainnet](https://superbridge.app/base)
- [Base Sepolia (Testnet)](https://superbridge.app/base-sepolia)

## Brid.gg

Brid.gg is another option that also helps you bridge ETH and supported assets between Ethereum mainnet (L1) and Base.

#### Supported Networks

- [Base Mainnet](https://brid.gg/base)
- [Base Sepolia (Testnet)](https://testnet.brid.gg/base-sepolia)

## Programmatic Bridging

See the [sample code repository](https://github.com/base-org/guides/tree/main/bridge/native) to see how to bridge ETH and ERC-20s from Ethereum to Base.

<Warning>
**Double check the token address for ERC-20s** You can use any ERC-20 that is
supported on the network. You can check what assets are on Base and the
corresponding contract address via [this hub](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/tree/master/data).
Ensure there is an address for `base`, [example](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/blob/master/data/WETH/data.json#L16-L18).
Always test with small amounts to ensure the system is working as expected.
</Warning>


<Warning>
This implementation can only bridge assets to Base. Do not attempt to alter the
code to withdraw the assets.
</Warning>


## FAQ

<Accordion title="Why has Base deprecated the bridge on bridge.base.org?">
Base is committed to decentralization and the Superchain vision. Leveraging the community to bootstrap the Superchain bridges is a step in that direction; increasing censorship resistance and decentralization.
