AI Agents become exponentially more powerful when they're onchain! By deploying AI agents on Base, you unlock access to **stablecoins**, **tokens**, **NFTs**, and a vast ecosystem of **DeFi protocols**. This significantly increases their autonomy and the universe of tasks they can perform, from automated trading to complex multi-step financial operations.

## What You'll Build

By the end of this guide, you'll have deployed a fully functional AI agent that can:

- **Execute onchain transactions** autonomously
- **Interact with DeFi protocols** for trading and liquidity
- **Manage digital assets** including tokens and NFTs
- **Respond to market conditions** with intelligent automation

## Prerequisites

Before launching your AI agent, ensure you have the following setup:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Development Environment">
    Choose your preferred development environment and ensure you have the necessary tools installed.
    
    **For Local Development:**
    - Node.js 18+ or Python 3.10+
    - Git for repository management
    - Code editor (VS Code recommended)
    
    **For Replit (Browser-based):**
    - Replit account for cloud development
    - No local installation required
    
    <Tip>
    Replit is perfect for quick prototyping, while local development gives you more control and flexibility.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="API Keys and Credentials">
    Gather the required API keys for your AI agent:
    
    - **Coinbase Developer Platform (CDP) API Key**: [Get your CDP credentials](https://www.coinbase.com/cloud)
    - **OpenAI API Key**: [Create an OpenAI account](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) for AI capabilities
    - **Base Network Access**: Your agent will operate on Base Sepolia testnet initially
    
    <Warning>
    Store all API keys securely and never commit them to version control. Use environment variables for all sensitive credentials.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Understanding Agent Frameworks">
    Choose the framework that best fits your needs:
    
    - **LangChain**: Full-featured framework with extensive integrations
