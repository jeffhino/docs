  </Step>
</Steps>

## Implementation Guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Your Product in Coinbase Commerce">
    
    First, you'll create a product in Coinbase Commerce that represents what you're selling.

    1. **Log in** to your [Coinbase Commerce dashboard](https://beta.commerce.coinbase.com/)
    2. Navigate to the [product creation page](https://beta.commerce.coinbase.com/products)
    3. **Fill in your product details**:
       - Product name (clear and descriptive)
       - Description (what customers are buying)
       - Price (in your preferred currency)
    4. Click **Create product**
    5. Once created, select **View product** and copy the **UUID** from the URL

    <Frame>
      ![Create product screenshot](/images/onchainkit-tutorials/pay-create-product-details.png)
    </Frame>

    <Tip>
    Save the product UUID immediately - you'll need it as an environment variable. The UUID appears in the product URL after creation.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Up Your Development Environment">
    
    Clone the official OnchainKit app template to get started quickly with best practices already configured.

    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash Bun
    git clone https://github.com/coinbase/onchainkit-app-template.git
    cd onchainkit-app-template
    bun install
    ```

    ```bash npm
    git clone https://github.com/coinbase/onchainkit-app-template.git
    cd onchainkit-app-template
    npm install
    ```

    ```bash Yarn
    git clone https://github.com/coinbase/onchainkit-app-template.git
    cd onchainkit-app-template
    yarn install
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

    <Check>
    Verify the installation completed successfully by running `ls` to see the project files.
    </Check>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Environment Variables">
    
    Create your environment configuration with the required API keys and identifiers.

    In your project root, create or update your `.env.local` file:

    ```bash .env.local
    # Coinbase Commerce Product ID (from Step 1)
    NEXT_PUBLIC_PRODUCT_ID=your_product_uuid_here

    # Coinbase Developer Platform API Key
    NEXT_PUBLIC_ONCHAINKIT_API_KEY=your_cdp_api_key_here

    # Reown (WalletConnect) Project ID
    NEXT_PUBLIC_WC_PROJECT_ID=your_walletconnect_project_id_here

    # Disable Next.js telemetry (optional)
    NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1
    ```

    <Warning>
    Never commit API keys to version control. Add `.env.local` to your `.gitignore` file.
    </Warning>

    <Tip>
    Use descriptive variable names and keep them organized with comments for team members.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Smart Wallet Integration">
    
    Set up Wagmi to prioritize smart wallets for better user experience.

    Update your Wagmi configuration file (typically `src/app/wagmi.ts`):

    ```typescript src/app/wagmi.ts
    // ... existing Wagmi configuration

    // After your useMemo() hook, add:
    coinbaseWallet.preference = 'smartWalletOnly';
    ```

    <Note>
    This configuration ensures users connect with smart wallets, which provide enhanced security and better UX.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Up OnchainKit Provider">
    
    Configure the OnchainKit provider to connect with Base network and your CDP API key.

    Update `src/app/components/OnchainProviders.tsx`:

    ```typescript src/app/components/OnchainProviders.tsx
    'use client';
    import { OnchainKitProvider } from '@coinbase/onchainkit';
    import { RainbowKitProvider } from '@rainbow-me/rainbowkit';
    import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query';
    import type { ReactNode } from 'react';
    import { base } from 'viem/chains';
    import { WagmiProvider } from 'wagmi';
    import { useWagmiConfig } from '../wagmi';

    type Props = { children: ReactNode };
    const queryClient = new QueryClient();

    function OnchainProviders({ children }: Props) {
      const wagmiConfig = useWagmiConfig();
      
      return (
        <WagmiProvider config={wagmiConfig}>
          <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
            <OnchainKitProvider
              apiKey={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ONCHAINKIT_API_KEY}
              chain={base}
            >
              <RainbowKitProvider modalSize='compact'>
                {children}
              </RainbowKitProvider>
            </OnchainKitProvider>
          </QueryClientProvider>
        </WagmiProvider>
      );
    }

    export default OnchainProviders;
    ```

    Update your configuration file to handle environment variables properly:

    ```typescript Config.ts
    export const NEXT_PUBLIC_URL =
      process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'
        ? 'http://localhost:3000'
        : 'https://your-app-domain.vercel.app'; // Replace with your actual domain

    export const NEXT_PUBLIC_CDP_API_KEY =
      process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ONCHAINKIT_API_KEY;

    export const NEXT_PUBLIC_WC_PROJECT_ID =
      process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_WC_PROJECT_ID;
    ```

    <Tip>
    Using environment variables makes your app more secure and easier to deploy across different environments.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Implement the Payment Interface">
    
    Create an attractive payment interface that showcases your product and handles the checkout flow.

    Update your main page (`src/app/page.tsx`):

    ```typescript src/app/page.tsx
    import { Checkout, CheckoutButton, CheckoutStatus } from '@coinbase/onchainkit/checkout';
    import Image from 'next/image';

    const productId = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PRODUCT_ID;

    export default function PaymentPage() {
      return (
        <main className="flex min-h-screen flex-col items-center justify-center p-4">
          <div className="max-w-2xl w-full">
            {/* Product showcase section */}
            <section className="flex w-full flex-col items-center justify-center gap-6 rounded-xl bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-50 to-white p-8 shadow-lg">
              
              {/* Product image container */}
              <div className="flex h-[400px] w-[400px] max-w-full items-center justify-center rounded-xl bg-gradient-to-br from-gray-900 to-gray-800 shadow-xl">
                <div className="rounded-lg bg-white p-4 shadow-inner">
                  <Image 
                    src="/your-product-image.jpg" 
                    width={320} 
                    height={320} 
                    alt="Product image" 
                    className="rounded-lg"
                  />
                </div>
              </div>

              {/* Product information */}
              <div className="text-center space-y-2">
                <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900">Your Amazing Product</h1>
                <p className="text-gray-600">High-quality product with crypto payment support</p>
              </div>

              {/* Payment section */}
              <div className="w-full max-w-md">
                {address ? (
                  <Checkout productId={productId}>
                    <CheckoutButton 
                      coinbaseBranded={true}
                      className="w-full"
                    />
                    <CheckoutStatus />
                  </Checkout>
                ) : (
                  <WalletWrapper 
                    className="w-full" 
                    text="Connect wallet to purchase" 
                  />
                )}
              </div>
            </section>
          </div>
        </main>
      );
    }
    ```

    <Warning>
    Make sure to add your product image to the `public` folder and update the image path accordingly.
    </Warning>

    <Check>
    The conditional rendering prevents errors when no wallet is connected, providing a smooth user experience.
    </Check>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test and Deploy Your Application">
    
    Test your payment flow locally before deploying to production.

    **Local Testing:**

    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash Bun
    bun run dev
    ```

    ```bash npm
    npm run dev
    ```

    ```bash Yarn
    yarn dev
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

    1. **Visit** `http://localhost:3000`
    2. **Connect your wallet** using the wallet connection button
    3. **Test the checkout flow** with a small amount
    4. **Verify payment status** updates correctly

    <Frame>
      ![Final product screenshot](/images/onchainkit-tutorials/pay-final-product.png)
    </Frame>

    **Production Deployment:**

    1. **Update your configuration** with production URLs
    2. **Deploy to your preferred platform** (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
    3. **Test the live application** with real transactions
    4. **Monitor payment confirmations** in your Coinbase Commerce dashboard

    <Tip>
    Start with testnet transactions to ensure everything works before going live with mainnet.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
</Steps>
