title: 'Unsupported Calls'
---

Base Account implements an Ethereum Provider JavaScript API (as detailed in [EIP-1193](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1193))
and follows the [ERC-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337) standard for account abstraction.

This means that apps interacting with Base Account can expect it to behave like a regular Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) account.
However, there are some calls that are not supported by Base Accounts for incompatibility or security reasons.
This is a list of calls that are not supported:

- [Self Calls](#self-calls): This refers to the ability of an app to use the user's account to call itself.
- [CREATE](#create): This refers to the ability of an app to create a new contract using the OPCODE `CREATE`.

## Self Calls

For security reasons, we do not allow 3rd party apps to make calls to a user's own Base Account address.
This could allow apps to change owners, upgrade the user's account, or cause other issues.

## CREATE

This is a limitation of the ERC-4337 standard and smart accounts.
Currently, we do not support the `CREATE` opcode for smart contracts deployment.
Future versions of Base Account may support it.

<Tip>
You can use a factory contract or a transaction with the `CREATE2` opcode to deploy a smart contract.
