In this guide we illustrate how to use Base Account and Zora's content coin SDK to create an engaging consumer application with great UX.

Memecoins and culturecoins have been catalysts of the onchain economy, allowing people to rally around concepts that are fun and engaging with a potential upside.

Memecoins are great for long term community and culture building onchain.
Contentcoins are an emergent category of coins focused on valuing individual pieces of content and providing monetization for creators.

Apps like [Zora](https://zora.co/) or [Flaunch](https://flaunch.gg/) illustrate the power of contentcoins.
They create a new category of apps that we may call "contentcoin apps".

## Overview

This example explains "Coin Your Bangers", a full onchain app that lets users turn their jokes into coins on Base.
The app uses OpenAI to generate coin metadata and the [Zora SDK](https://docs.zora.co/coins/sdk/create-coin) to coin the content.
From the user's perspective, the process is simple:

1. Input a joke or funny content
2. Generate coin metadata using AI
3. Deploy a new Zora Coin on Base
4. Get transaction confirmation and links
5. Start earning referal fees from your the app
6. Start earning trading fees from your Coin

The full codebase of this app is available on Github:

## Why use Base Account to build your contentcoin app?

Onboarding users to end-consumer onchain apps has always been a challenge, mainly
due to the need for a wallet. In the case of web apps, this has always come in the form of a
new browser extension to install or a new mobile app to download.
In order to solve this, Base Account was created.

Base Account is a new way to universally sign in into any onchain app.
This example shows how Base Account can seamlessly onboard users without the need for an installation.
If you are building an app for creators and end-consumers, it is important to meet them where they are.
Base Account allows you to onboard them with passkeys, a simple pop-up, and no new extension to install.

<Check>
**Does Zora use Base Account?**

Yes, Zora integrates Base Account smart contracts directly into their protocol.
This allows users to sign in to the app and create contentcoins without any additional steps.

You can see the share of Zora from Base Account transactions on the [Dune Dashboard](https://dune.com/wilsoncusack/coinbase-smart-wallet-kpis).

## Run the app

1. Open a terminal and run the following commands:

```bash Terminal
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/base/demos.git

# Navigate to the app
cd demos/smart-wallet/coin-your-joke
```

Install dependencies:

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm install
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm install
```

```bash yarn
yarn install
```

```bash bun
bun install
```
</CodeGroup>

```bash Terminal
# Copy the environment variables
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Open the repository in your favorite editor (eg. Cursor, VSCode, etc.) and edit the `.env` file with your own values as specified in the [README](https://github.com/base/demos/blob/master/smart-wallet/coin-your-joke/README.md).

```
ENV=local or prod
NEXT_PUBLIC_URL=your_deployment_url (http://localhost:3000 for local development)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1
```

3. Run the app

```bash Terminal
pnpm dev
```

## Key Components

### Wagmi Config (`wagmi.ts`)

The wagmi config is used to set up the Base Account client.

```ts
import { http, cookieStorage, createConfig, createStorage } from "wagmi";
import { base, baseSepolia } from "wagmi/chains";
import { coinbaseWallet } from "wagmi/connectors";

export const cbWalletConnector = coinbaseWallet({
  appName: "Base Account Zora Coiner",
  preference: "smartWalletOnly",
});

export function getConfig() {
  return createConfig({
    chains: [base, baseSepolia],
    connectors: [cbWalletConnector],
    // ... other config options
  });
}

// ... other wagmi config options
```

### CoinButton Component (`CoinButton.tsx`)

The deployment button component handles the actual token creation:

```tsx
export function CoinButton({
  name,
  symbol,
  uri,
  initialPurchaseWei = BigInt(0),
  onSuccess,
  onError,
  className
}: CreateCoinArgs) {
  // ... implementation
}
```

Key features:

- Using Zora's [`createCoin`](https://docs.zora.co/coins/sdk/create-coin) function to create a new coin
- Using Base Account and Wagmi to submit the transaction
- Loading states and error handling
- Transaction status tracking

### Metadata Generation API

The API endpoint uses OpenAI to generate creative coin metadata:

```typescript
// Example API structure
async function generateMetadata(joke: string) {
  // 1. Process the joke using OpenAI
  // 2. Generate coin name and symbol
  // 3. Create metadata JSON
  // 4. Return coin parameters
}
```

Features:

- OpenAI integration for creative naming
- Metadata JSON generation
- URI creation for token metadata
- Error handling and validation

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 13+ with App Router
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Onchain tools**:
  - Base Account for Sign In
  - Wagmi for contract interactions
  - Zora SDK for coining content
- **AI**: OpenAI API for metadata generation
- **Network**: Base

## Deployment

You can deploy your app to Vercel by following the instructions [here](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments).

## Conclusion

This example demonstrates how to build a full-featured onchain application that combines:

- Base Account for Sign In
- AI capabilities
- Coin creation with [Zora's SDK](https://docs.zora.co/coins/sdk/create-coin)
- Wagmi for contract interactions
- Error handling
- Transaction management

The modular architecture makes it easy to extend or modify for other use cases beyond joke tokenization.
