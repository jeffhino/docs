title: "NextJS with Privy"
description: "Integrate Base Account with Privy"
---


We are working with [Privy](https://www.privy.io/) to integrate Base Account with their SDK.

A full guide and example will be available soon.
In the meantime, you can use the connector from the [Wagmi guide](/base-account/framework-integrations/nextjs-with-wagmi)
with [Privy+Wagmi](https://docs.privy.io/wallets/connectors/ethereum/integrations/wagmi) as a workaround.
