title: "NextJS with Dynamic"
description: "Integrate Base Account with Dynamic"
---


We are working with [Dynamic](https://www.dynamic.xyz/) to integrate Base Account with their SDK.

A full guide and example will be available soon.
In the meantime, you can use the connector from the [Wagmi guide](/base-account/framework-integrations/nextjs-with-wagmi)
with [Dynamic+Wagmi](https://www.dynamic.xyz/docs/react-sdk/using-wagmi) as a workaround.
